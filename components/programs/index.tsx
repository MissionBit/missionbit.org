          Mission Bit provides free semester-long project-based coding courses
          to high school students from underserved and underrepresented
          communities. We offer our students career and college advising related
          to the technology field, a field trip to a Bay Area tech company, and
          an opportunity to showcase their group projects to a large community
          of supporters during our Demo Day event at the end of the term. Our
          programâ€™s inclusive community fosters positive relationships between
          students, their peers, and our experienced classroom leaders. Mission
          Bit brings like-minded individuals together to form long-lasting
          meaningful connections and gives students all the tools they need to
          succeed in the tech industry.

          There are no GPA requirements and any San Francisco public or charter
          school student is encouraged to apply. Given the lack of diversity in
          the tech industry and our focus on equity, we accept applications from
          students of color and girls who attend private schools in San
          Francisco, as well.
